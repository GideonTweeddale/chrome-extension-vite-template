Welcome to a Chrome Extension Template with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind support.

This template provides a basic structure for building a Chrome extension using Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind. It includes the following features:

* **Vite**: A fast and lightweight build tool for modern web projects.
* **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language.
* **Tailwind**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.\
3. When you're ready to build the production version of your extension, run `npm run build`. This will create a `dist` directory with the compiled and bundled extension files.
4. To load the extension in Chrome, go to the `chrome://extensions` page and enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner. Then click the "Load unpacked" button and select the `dist` directory.

Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

* `manifest.json`: The Chrome extension manifest file, which specifies the extension's metadata and permissions.
* `src`: The directory containing the source code for the extension.
* `src/background.ts`: The TypeScript file for the service worker script.
* `src/popup.html`: The HTML file for the extension's popup window.
* `vite.config.ts`: The Vite configuration file.

I hope this template helps you get started with building your Chrome extension! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to see any additional features added.

Happy coding!
